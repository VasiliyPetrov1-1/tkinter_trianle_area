Triangle Area Calculator

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python's Tkinter module, which allows users to calculate the area of a triangle. The user can choose between two methods for calculating the area:

    Base and Height: The user inputs the base and height of the triangle.
    Two Sides and Angle: The user inputs two sides and the angle between them, with an option to choose between degrees or radians for the angle.

The program displays the result in a pop-up message once the user clicks the "Calculate" button.

To start the program, run the following command in the terminal:

``python triangle.py``
